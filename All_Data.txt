you will let it fly away
and the rabbit did not do it
he just kept on untying the balloon
and all of a sudden the rabbit let the balloon go and started crying PAUSE1 when it was not his
it was the dog's
and he started running after it and yelling help help
all of a sudden the dog got mad at the rabbit
and the rabbit started crying

PAUSE2 the giraffe and the elephant are at PAUSE1 a beach party

suddenly PAUSE1 the elephant drops the ball into the pool
so the giraffe PAUSE1 goes to get it
the elephant looks worried because the pool is very deep
and the giraffe might drowned
and PAUSE1 the giraffe does not drowned PAUSE1 because his neck is very long and PAUSE1 gives the ball PAUSE1 to the elephant
and PAUSE1 then the PAUSE1 giraffe feels very proud of himself
and the elephant thinks he looks cute that way
PAUSE1 the giraffe and PAUSE1 the PAUSE1 elephant are at the pool again PAUSE1 because they are having swimming lessons
and PAUSE1 the elephant PAUSE1 is running PAUSE1 into the pool
suddenly she slips PAUSE1 and falls
then the giraffe sees her crying PAUSE1 because she has PAUSE1 an owie on her knee
he calls the lifeguard
and the lifeguard comes running
he puts a bandage on PAUSE1 the PAUSE1 elephant
and PAUSE1 she thinks it is going to hurt
but it PAUSE1 does not
and then he puts the elephant onto the bench for her to sit for awhile
the lifeguard points to a sign saying no running
and she PAUSE1 won't do it ever again
the giraffe brought a new toy to PAUSE1 the swimming pool
and the elephant really likes it
he plays with the airplane
and PAUSE2 has a really cool string at the end
the elephant snatches it away from the giraffe PAUSE1 and thinks it is really PAUSE1 cool
and she is flying it around
but then it PAUSE1 drops into the pool
and its PAUSE1 flinger thing breaks
and the propeller thing PAUSE1 breaks off
and it goes deeper deeper into the water
and the giraffe is really mad at the elephant
but PAUSE1 she makes an innocent face on her PAUSE1 face
the PAUSE1 giraffe calls the lifeguard
and PAUSE1 he PAUSE1 comes to the pool and finds PAUSE1 the PAUSE2 airplane in the pool
the elephant is explaining to the lifeguard what happened
and she feels really sorry
so the lifeguard tries to PAUSE1 get PAUSE1 the PAUSE2 airplane PAUSE1 and give it back to the PAUSE1 giraffe
the giraffe PAUSE1 is crying PAUSE1 because it goes deeper deeper into the water
and PAUSE1 the other lifeguard with the net comes and PAUSE1 PAUSE1 gets the PAUSE2 plane
and the giraffe PAUSE1 has one more tear
but then it goes
and everyone feels happy
the giraffe has no more tears and PAUSE1 is smiling
the lifeguard is smiling too PAUSE1 and gives the plane back PAUSE1 to the PAUSE1 giraffe

the kangaroo PAUSE1 was building a sandcastle
and then PAUSE1 her friend rabbit came along
he put PAUSE1 some sand into PAUSE1 a big bucket PAUSE1 and PAUSE1 started to build something
then PAUSE1 the kangaroo realized that PAUSE1 the bunny was making a sandcastle PAUSE1 right PAUSE1 in front of it
but it spilled all over the castle
the mountain of sand PAUSE1 covered half of the castle
and only a little bit was left
the PAUSE1 kangaroo started crying
and the bunny PAUSE1 made an innocent face on his face
bunny was going down to the forest for a picnic
and PAUSE1 he saw PAUSE1 kangaroo there too
they said hi and PAUSE1 found a place for their picnic
PAUSE1 kangaroo never realized PAUSE1 how big of a eater bunny was
and PAUSE1 he packed PAUSE1 no food but just junk food
after he was done PAUSE1 he looked like an enormous pig PAUSE1 because his belly was PAUSE1 big
and PAUSE1 kangaroo was drinking PAUSE1 her juice and eating her sandwich
then PAUSE1 bunny started hiccupping PAUSE1 and PAUSE1 burping PAUSE1 and had a tummyache
and PAUSE1 kangaroo just realized that
she started running PAUSE1 PAUSE1 to doctor bunny PAUSE1 and PAUSE1 said my friend looks like he is very sick
PAUSE1 she pulled doctor bunny there
and PAUSE1 PAUSE1 doctor bunny started looking at PAUSE1 bunny
she said you have been eating too much sweets PAUSE1 and candy PAUSE1 and not enough healthy PAUSE1 nutritious stuff
you should PAUSE1 eat your dessert after but only a little bit of dessert
or else you will feel very sick
so doctor bunny PAUSE1 took bunny home PAUSE1 to his mother
and PAUSE1 he told her all about the things PAUSE1 that he ate and did PAUSE1 today
one day PAUSE1 PAUSE3 joey the kangaroo was in the forest
and bunny PAUSE1 saw her with her balloon PAUSE1 tucked PAUSE1 onto PAUSE1 the wheel of her PAUSE2 wagon
he said PAUSE1 hey I really like that
is there any more around
kangaroo said I do not know
the balloon man might be PAUSE1 somewhere far from here
and bunny tried to take it off PAUSE1 for him
but PAUSE1 kangaroo said hey that is mine
and I really like it
it is my favorite color
and PAUSE1 then PAUSE1 bunny PAUSE1 realized that he was not alone
he looked very nervous
suddenly he let go of the balloon
bunny PAUSE1 realized that the PAUSE1 balloon was PAUSE1 high up in the sky
and no one could catch it because it was going high PAUSE1 too fast
kangaroo looked very mad at bunny
then they saw the balloon man PAUSE1 with PAUSE1 more of kangaroo's favorite colors and bunny's too PAUSE1 purple and blue
bunny asked for a blue PAUSE2 balloon
the man said PAUSE1 that would be PAUSE1 one dollar please
bunny looked in his pockets
PAUSE1 that is five cents for a balloon
oh bunny looked in his pockets
and he only kept his money at home
then PAUSE1 mister bunny PAUSE1 said well I guess you can not buy a PAUSE1 balloon if you do not have five cents
then they saw a doctor bunny there PAUSE2 and said PAUSE1 miss bunny PAUSE1 can me and my friend please have five cents each
we really want a purple and blue PAUSE1 balloon
bunny pointed it out and PAUSE1 lifted up his pockets
oh you have no money said PAUSE1 miss PAUSE1 bunny
I guess I will hafta give you five cents each
so she gave the man five cents
and PAUSE1 bunny got a blue balloon
and PAUSE1 kangaroo got PAUSE1 a purple one
thank you said the man for the coins
and they PAUSE1 both played with their PAUSE1 balloons
and PAUSE1 miss bunny said make sure you tie it somewhere safe PAUSE1 so it does not get loose and float PAUSE1 away

first there is an PAUSE1 elephant PAUSE1 and a giraffe
and the elephant is bouncing a ball
turn
and PAUSE1 the elephant I think bounces it into a pool
and then PAUSE1 the PAUSE1 giraffe dives in to get it
and then PAUSE1 the giraffe PAUSE1 comes back PAUSE1 and gives it PAUSE1 to the elephant
and the elephant PAUSE1 looks like he is saying thank you
PAUSE1 there is a giraffe and an elephant PAUSE1 standing by a pool
and there is a sign that says no running
so the PAUSE1 elephant points at the diving board
and PAUSE1 she runs over there
and she slips
and she scrapes her knee
and then the lifeguard comes PAUSE2 and puts a bandaid PAUSE1 on PAUSE1 her
then he PAUSE1 put heron a bench PAUSE1 to sit down
and then the lifeguard PAUSE1 points his finger out saying bad PAUSE1 I think
there is an elephant and a giraffe
and PAUSE1 the giraffe is flying a toy plane around
and then the elephant PAUSE1 looks at it and I think says PAUSE1 that is interesting
so the PAUSE1 giraffe gives a turn to the elephant
and the elephant is PAUSE1 PAUSE1 threw it into the pool
and the giraffe gets PAUSE1 mad at the elephant
so the elephant asks the lifeguard to help PAUSE2 and then talks PAUSE1 to the lifeguard what happens
and the lifeguard tries PAUSE1 to reach PAUSE1 and get it
then the lifeguard does not know what to do
and the giraffe PAUSE1 goes on his knees and starts to cry
so I think PAUSE1 a person that swims takes a net PAUSE1 and tries to scoop it
and she scoops it up PAUSE1 and gives it back to the giraffe
and PAUSE1 the giraffe holds it like this by his neck
and the elephant PAUSE1 has his hands PAUSE1 like that in front of the giraffe
there is I think a PAUSE1 bunny and a dog
and PAUSE1 the dog built a sandcastle
and the bunny I think PAUSE1 wants to help
the dog is smoothing the sides out while the PAUSE1 bunny is digging sand out for PAUSE1 the sandcastle
and PAUSE1 then the bunny pours it PAUSE1 all over the sandcastle
and it destroys the sandcastle
and then PAUSE1 the PAUSE1 dog cries and PAUSE1 tries to build a new one
PAUSE1 there is a PAUSE1 bunny and a dog PAUSE1 that have their baskets with food in them
and PAUSE1 then the PAUSE1 bunny dumps it all out
and PAUSE1 the dog just takes it one at a time
and then PAUSE1 the dog is PAUSE1 still eating
and PAUSE1 the bunny is laying on the ground with all this garbage around
and then PAUSE2 the PAUSE1 dog is drinking a juice box
and PAUSE1 I think the bunny feels sick
and then the PAUSE1 dog PAUSE1 I think finds a doctor
and the dog is pulling the doctor's sleeve over to where PAUSE1 the bunny is laying down
and PAUSE1 PAUSE1 the doctor PAUSE1 takes this little stick and PAUSE2 like PAUSE1 points at something
and then PAUSE1 the PAUSE1 doctor brings PAUSE1 the PAUSE1 bunny PAUSE1 I think home
and PAUSE1 PAUSE1 the PAUSE2 dog is just standing still PAUSE1 with PAUSE1 a thing behind her back
first PAUSE1 the PAUSE1 dog is pulling a wagon with a balloon attached to it
then the PAUSE1 dog drops the handle
and PAUSE1 the bunny PAUSE1 looks at it
and then PAUSE1 the bunny tries to untie it
and it PAUSE1 blows away into the sky
and then the dog gets mad at PAUSE1 him
and then PAUSE1 PAUSE1 the dog is mad
the bunny runs over
and he sees PAUSE1 a balloon man PAUSE1 selling balloons
and PAUSE1 the bunny takes one of the balloons
PAUSE1 and on one of the balloons it says PAUSE1 balloons five cents
and then the bunny pulls out the inside of his pockets
and he has got no coins
so PAUSE1 the PAUSE1 balloon PAUSE1 guy PAUSE1 was holding the balloons
and PAUSE1 the bunny PAUSE1 has his hands in his pockets PAUSE1 with the dog behind him
PAUSE1 the dog is standing by the balloon guy
and PAUSE1 the rabbit sees PAUSE1 PAUSE1 this lady
and then PAUSE1 he tells the lady to I think get him a balloon
and then PAUSE1 the lady takes out her wallet and puts PAUSE1 some coins in her hand

once there was a giraffe PAUSE1 who was standing by a pool
and a elephant PAUSE1 came PAUSE1 with PAUSE1 a swimsuit on PAUSE1 and said you wanna play fetch
but PAUSE1 they were not so sure about playing near the pool
just then when the elephant PAUSE1 blew it with her trunk PAUSE1 it fell in the pool
the giraffe PAUSE1 jumped in PAUSE1 and swam to get the ball
the giraffe PAUSE1 came back with it PAUSE1 in a minute
PAUSE1 and the elephant said PAUSE1 oh PAUSE1 you got my ball
thank you
sometimes I get mixed up with the words
the giraffe PAUSE1 felt pleased that he got the ball PAUSE1 for her friend
but the elephant just stood there and smiled
the end
the giraffe and the elephant went to the pool because it was a hot summer day
they looked at the pool
and they were excited
but the elephant said hey I am going to go off the diving board
but she did not read the sign PAUSE1 which said no running
so she ran anyway
just then PAUSE1 the giraffe was catching up with her when she slipped PAUSE1 and fell on her knee
she got PAUSE1 a cut on her knee
and the giraffe went to get someone
a lifeguard PAUSE1 came PAUSE1 as quickly as possible PAUSE1 and helped the elephant
the elephant thought it was going to sting
but PAUSE1 it did not
they put on the bandage
and it looked good as new
the lifeguard was disappointed
and the girl PAUSE1 sat on the bench and said hi
and the lifeguard was pointing at the no running sign
the end
the giraffe and the elephant went to play by the pool
and the giraffe PAUSE1 got a new toy plane and said you wanna play with me
the elephant said sure
the giraffe flew the plane first
but the elephant was so excited PAUSE1 she just grabbed it out of her hands
the giraffe said my plane give it back
I was not done my turn
but the elephant did not care
she was just flying it around
just then she PAUSE1 flew it PAUSE1 too high
and PAUSE1 it fell in the pool
and it started to sink
the giraffe was mad at the elephant
but the elephant just stood there puzzled
the lifeguard came PAUSE1 right by the two girls
and PAUSE1 one of the elephants said I can explain
I did not do it
it was the giraffe
just then the giraffe said PAUSE1 she is lying
it was her
then PAUSE1 like it was a big argument
so the lifeguard said cool it
who dropped it in the pool
and the giraffe was pointing at the elephant
the lifeguard tried to catch it
but it was floating PAUSE1 in the pool
the giraffe started to cry PAUSE1 when the lifeguard said he could not reach it
and the PAUSE1 elephant felt sorry
just then a lady elephant came with a net
she PAUSE1 quickly got the plane PAUSE1 with the net
PAUSE1 and she pulled it PAUSE1 PAUSE1 to her
she said here you go
is this your airplane
and the giraffe said yes PAUSE1 thank you very much
the giraffe hugged her plane
but the elephant PAUSE1 was happy
the end
one day at the park PAUSE1 there was PAUSE1 a baby dog PAUSE1 who was making a sandcastle
just then a bunny PAUSE1 came along and said PAUSE1 can I help you
the dog said sure
they wanted to help build the biggest sandcastle in the world
so the rabbit was going to build it
so he got some sand in a pail and started digging
just then PAUSE1 he decided that a shovel was not so slow after all
so he decided to dump it on the PAUSE1 castle
so he did
but PAUSE1 when he realized he had wrecked it PAUSE1 he was so embarrassed
the dog started to cry PAUSE1 and rebuild the sandcastle
but the rabbit just stood there PAUSE1 and looked like he did nothing
the end
PAUSE1 there once was a dog who was going on a picnic in the PAUSE1 park
and then he saw a rabbit
so they decided to go together
when they unpacked the lunch PAUSE1 the rabbit was so hungry
the rabbit was so hungry
but the dog was not
so the rabbit ate all the stuff
when the dog was eating PAUSE1 the bunny had already finished
the bunny PAUSE1 had a terrible stomachache while the dog was eating
the dog just stood there puzzled and said are you okay
and the rabbit said no I feel like I am going to hurl
just then the dog PAUSE1 ran PAUSE1 to the PAUSE1 doctor who was standing right by the path
she said excuse me could you help my friend here
he has a stomachache
but the doctor said no
she had PAUSE1 a patient who was waiting for her
but the PAUSE1 dog PAUSE1 really needed her
so she PAUSE1 took the doctor and dragged them to the PAUSE1 picnic
the doctor said PAUSE1 I will take your temperature now
and you will feel much better
just then the bunny got up
and he felt queasy
then the doctor and the bunny PAUSE1 went PAUSE1 home
they walked together PAUSE1 back home

then he saw the bunny
then they wanted to play with the balloon
the bunny wanted to PAUSE1 touch the balloon PAUSE1 because PAUSE1 he thought it was PAUSE1 cool
but the dog did not PAUSE1 really want him to
so PAUSE1 just then the rabbit PAUSE1 did not care about what the dog said
so PAUSE1 the rabbit PAUSE1 untied the balloon
and the dog was beginning to get a little fed up
just then the balloon floated away
and they were trying to catch it
but they were too short
the dog was so angry at the rabbit
the rabbit just PAUSE1 stared at the balloon
and he felt like PAUSE1 he was getting a little scared PAUSE1 because the dog was mad
just then they saw a balloon seller PAUSE1 who had PAUSE1 tons of balloons
and he just stood there
so PAUSE1 the dog and the rabbit decided to go buy a new one
the rabbit said may I have a balloon PAUSE1 please for my friend over there
the man said sure but PAUSE2 you will hafta pay PAUSE1 for the balloon
the rabbit looked through his pockets
just then PAUSE1 PAUSE1 a sign said PAUSE1 balloons five cents
and he did not have five cents
the rabbit PAUSE1 and the PAUSE1 dog looked at the balloon seller
they told him that they did not have five cents
just then PAUSE2 the bunny PAUSE1 went to a lady who was standing nearby
and he said excuse me do you have five cents because I needta buy a balloon for PAUSE1 a friend
the rabbit PAUSE1 looked puzzled
but the rabbit said my friend needs one PAUSE1 now because we do not have any change
the lady rabbit PAUSE1 gave five cents PAUSE1 for two balloons
and PAUSE1 the bunny and the dog were jumping up and down PAUSE1 in excitement
then PAUSE1 they both got balloons

once upon a time an elephant and his friend the giraffe were playing with PAUSE1 the elephant's purple bouncy ball
when she was bouncing the ball she dropped it into the swimming pool
the giraffe was a very good swimmer
so he swam up PAUSE1 out and grabbed the ball
he swam over to the elephant PAUSE1 and PAUSE1 gave it to her
and then they decided to play some more
one day the elephant and her friend the giraffe decided to go swimming
the elephant ran to the diving board
and the giraffe just decided to walk because he saw the sign that said no running
the elephant continued running
then he started running after her
when he was running the elephant slipped and scraped her knee
the giraffe called the lifeguard
and PAUSE1 he ran over
he put a bandage on the mark
and then he left to solve another problem
the lifeguard sat her on the bench
and PAUSE1 the giraffe sat down beside her
the other lifeguard PAUSE1 decided to kick her out because she has a bandage on
one day the elephant met PAUSE1 PAUSE1 her friend the giraffe at the swimming pool
he was playing with his airplane
and the elephant PAUSE1 got hypnotized
she grabbed it from his hand PAUSE1 and PAUSE1 dropped it in the pool
the giraffe got mad at her
and she froze solid
the giraffe PAUSE1 got so mad PAUSE1 that he pushed her
the lifeguard tried to reach the PAUSE1 airplane
but PAUSE1 it was too far out
the elephant told the lifeguard that it was an accident and that she won't do it again
the lifeguard tried again
but it got PAUSE1 farther and farther out
then the other lifeguard came with a pool scooper and tried to reach it
the first time she tried she did not reach it
and then she was talking to the kids
and then she was talking to the other lifeguard
she tried a second time
she got the airplane and gave it back to the giraffe
the giraffe PAUSE1 smiled very firmly PAUSE1 and never went swimming with his airplane again
when they were done they decided to play in the playpen with the airplane instead of near the pool
one day PAUSE1 a bunny and his friend the dragon decided to go to the PAUSE1 sandbox and build a sandcastle
when they were adding on to the PAUSE1 castle the rabbit PAUSE1 was hogging the sand in the pail
when he was done PAUSE1 he poured PAUSE1 all the sand on the sandcastle
and then the sandcastle was ruined
when PAUSE1 the dragon PAUSE1 was trying to mold it again she was still crying
the end
one day PAUSE1 the rabbit and the PAUSE1 dragon PAUSE2 were walking down the street
and they saw each other with picnic baskets
since the rabbit had PAUSE1 cake PAUSE1 subs and sandwiches PAUSE1 and chips they decided to have a picnic together

and he looked like he was going to throw up
he was getting dizzy
and the dragon only had a juice box and two sandwiches
when the doctor was walking by PAUSE1 the dragon ran over to her and said that her friend PAUSE1 was PAUSE1 sick
the dragon decided to drag her PAUSE1 to her friend the rabbit PAUSE1 because he was very sick
the doctor PAUSE1 tapped his head

and the dragon got mad at him
the balloon flew away

Rachelle was very happy
she thought that it was very interesting
so when they started to play with it Gerome showed her a trick that he found out with the airplane
Rachelle was very shocked and surprised
Rachelle liked it so much that she stole it out of Bob's hands and started to play with it herself
bob did not know what was happening
but when she played with it, it fell inside the swimming pool
bob got kind of sad
not only did he get sad PAUSE1 but he got really mad at Rachelle
and he said Rachelle now you hafta go get it
but Rachelle did not know how to swim
so they called over the lifeguard to go get it because Rachelle did not know how to swim and bob thought that it was only fair that she hadta get it because she threw it into the pool
the lifeguard said why did you throw it into the pool
and Rachelle said it is just an accident
and the lifeguard said why did you take it out of Bob's hand anyway
she said well it was really interesting
I just wanna see it
the next time you should ask
and Rachelle said can you please please get it
so he tried to get it
and he tried and tried
but he could not get it
Gerome started to feel sad that he would never get it again
so finally PAUSE1 Rachelle's mother came and had a big long net
and she was about to get it
and she got it PAUSE1 with the big net
she got the airplane all safe and sound no broken pieces
so then she gave it to bob
and bob started to get very happy and very excited that he could play with it again
he hugged and hugged it so much

last week there was a bunny named Babsand a dog named PAUSE1 Michelle
Babswas walking just on a walk
and she saw Michelle playing in a sandbox and building a sandcastle
she thought it would be fun
and she wanted to play too
so Michelle let her play with it
and they were making sandcastles and PAUSE1 all different kinds of animals
so then when Babspoured her bucket of sand all over the top of the castle PAUSE2 it broke it
Michelle was so sad
so was Babs
she thought it would make it better
but instead it made it worse
Michelle started to cry
and she started to fine her sandcastle again
but it was all coated with sand by the big bucket of sand
Babslooked embarrassed because she broke it
and now her friend was crying
here we are again with Babsand Michelle
Babswas walking along in the forest when she caught up with Michelle
they were going on a walk to a picnic
Michelle said oh look at the perfect view
and Babssaid it is so beautiful
why do not we have a picnic here
so they did
and Babsbrought a lot
he brought a cake submarine sandwich pickles cheese chips PAUSE1 and almost anything you could think of
and PAUSE1 Michelle only brought a couple things only things she needed
Babswas eating everything
after Michelle was finishing her juice and her sandwich PAUSE1 Babswas done everything
he had a gigantic stomach and started to burp the abcs
Babsgot really dizzy and felt sleepy
when Michelle was just about to finish her juice and sandwich PAUSE1 Babsfell asleep
so when he was sleeping PAUSE1 Michelle phoned the doctor because he was really dizzy
and he did not look very good
so when the doctor came she hurried over and told the doctor to come and see what was wrong
PAUSE1 Michelle kept dragging her over
but PAUSE1 when they were just a few feet away the doctor said he just sleeping
and he ate too much
do not worry
he will just be a couple minutes when he will get better
but she said but he does not look very good
you should come and see
but she did not wanna come and see
so she did
and when she tapped him on the head he started to bark even though he was a rabbit
the doctor thought something was wrong
but then PAUSE1 when she checked him PAUSE1 he was just right
all he did was eat a little too many PAUSE1 chips
last year in the middle of the spring time there was a dog named PAUSE1 Sarah and a rabbit named Christopher
as Sarah was walking with her new wagon PAUSE1 that she won from a parade with a balloon that she also got from the parade PAUSE1 she was walking and playing with it
when Christopher saw it he wanted to play too
he loved the balloon
he thought it was the best part of everything
he wanted to see it even closer because it was high in the sky
so when he wanted to untie it just so he see a little more Sarah thought he should not do it
but then she thought maybe I will get to see it closer too
but when he let go PAUSE1 the balloon started to sail way up high in the sky
Sarah started to feel sad and that she would never see it again
and Christopher was very sad because he wanted to see it even closer
but PAUSE1 he did not get it because he let it off
but then Sarah got really mad at Christopher because he let her favorite balloon off
and she started to throw a fit
then a guy was walking down the street with billions of balloons
while Sarah was still being mad at Christopher Christopher spotted him
and he thought maybe he should buy a balloon for her
so he said can I have one of those balloons
and can I have a purple one
he said sure
and the purple one was the biggest one
and he gave it to her
and as he was walking Sarah started to feel a little happier because he bought a balloon for her
at least she thought so
but when he looked in his pocket to buy a balloon he did not have any money
so then the guy that owned the balloons said you can not have it because you have no money
so Sarah started to walk towards him
so PAUSE1 Christopher put his hands in his pocket still trying to find something
and the guy said well you know what
just because you let her balloon off and since you are my grandson PAUSE1 I will let you have a balloon for free
but then he changed his mind again because he thought well even though he let it off he should still buy it for her
so then they saw PAUSE1 his mom walking down the street
and she said mom can I have five cents
and she did not hear him
and so she said it again
he said I need five cents
but I have none because I let Sarah's balloon go
and she really wants another one
so the lady paid the man ten cents actually so that they could both have a balloon
they were really happy
and they hugged the balloons a lot
and they said thank you to Christopher's mom
and then they went off to play again

and the PAUSE1 elephant was really PAUSE1 really upset that his ball was in the water
and the PAUSE1 zebra was like maybe I could go get it for her
so he jumped into the water and swam all the way
and the elephant was worried about the giraffe
and the giraffe almost had the ball
but then PAUSE1 he got it and came back PAUSE1 and gave it to the elephant
and the elephant was really happy that he got his ball
and then PAUSE1 the elephant PAUSE1 kind of thinked that the PAUSE1 giraffe was cute
and so did the PAUSE1 giraffe think the elephant was cute
one day an elephant and the giraffe went to the swimming pool together because they wanted to go swimming
and the elephant was running along

and then the elephant slipped
and then PAUSE1 the giraffe rushed over to her
and he never caught up
and the PAUSE1 elephant got a big cut on her leg
and the PAUSE1 giraffe was worried
so he went to go get some help
and then the lifeguard came over
and the giraffe PAUSE1 was beside the elephant
and the lifeguard PAUSE1 rushed over to her
and the elephant started to cry
and then the lifeguard gave her a bandaid
but it hurt the elephant when it got on
and the PAUSE1 giraffe was curious
why did he put on a bandaid
why did not he clean it up and stuff
and then they helped her to a bench
and the giraffe was going to help
and the elephant got her on the bench
and the elephant stuck out her leg
and the lifeguard PAUSE1 pointed to a sign that said no running
PAUSE1 and the elephant was like I was not running PAUSE1 PAUSE1
and the lifeguard is like no running at the swimming pool
you could slip and hurt yourself like you did
one day the elephant and the giraffe were at the swimming pool
but the giraffe PAUSE1 brought his plane with him
and the elephant liked planes a lot
so then the giraffe put it up in the air PAUSE1 twirled it around
and the elephant is like wow
and then she grabbed it out of the giraffe's hand
and she was like yes, I wanna play with this one
it is real fun
and then she accidentally dropped it in the water
and it started to sink
you could only see the top of it
and then the giraffe got really mad at the elephant
and the elephant is like oops
and then the lifeguard was on the other side
and he saw it
he is like how did that plane get in there
and they did not say nothing else
and then the elephant explained what happened to the lifeguard
and the lifeguard is PAUSE1 hm, maybe I can help
so he tried reaching over PAUSE1 to get the plane
but his arms were a little bit too short
and then the PAUSE1 giraffe started to cry
and the elephant looked very upset
and the lifeguard said there is nothing I can do
and then this lady came along PAUSE1 with a real long net
and they are like wow
could you help us get out my plane said the giraffe
and she said hm okay
so she bent over and tried reaching for the plane
and she got it
and then the PAUSE1 giraffe thought she would not get it
and then he started to cry
but then the lifeguard saw it PAUSE1 and is like yes she got it
and then she scooped it up PAUSE1 with her net and gave it to the giraffe
and the giraffe was really happy
and he said thanks missus
you are a real help
and then the giraffe got PAUSE1 his plane back

and he said okay

and then he poured all the sand on the castle
and then PAUSE1 the castle collapsed
it was full of sand
and the dog PAUSE1 looked very upset
but the bunny was oh no
so the dog started to cry
and the bunny felt very sad that he broke his sandcastle
one day a bunny and a dog went for a picnic PAUSE1 in the forest
the bunny packed lots of stuff
but the dog knew if he ate lots of stuff he will get a stomachache
so he just packed a little bit
the bunny ate all his stuff really really quickly
and his belly got real big
and then PAUSE1 the dog was eating slowly
so it did not get a stomachache
but then the bunny felt very sick and had a real big stomachache
and the dog did not know what to do
and then PAUSE1 a bunny nurse came by
and the PAUSE1 dog said I will help you bunny
I will go get that nurse
and then the nurse came
but PAUSE1 the dog struggled her over to the bunny PAUSE1 that was laying on the ground
the nurse told him to open up and say ah
and the bunny opened up
and then PAUSE1 she said stop eating so much food
you will get a PAUSE1 stomachache again
one day PAUSE1 the dog had a balloon with his wagon that he brought along with him to go walk by the park
and then he met the bunny again
and the bunny saw his balloon and wanted to play with it
and the dog said okay
and then the bunny got the balloon PAUSE2 and untied it
and the dog is like no

so he went over PAUSE1 to the guy with the balloons
and he picked one out
and the guy said PAUSE2 five cents PAUSE1 for this balloon
and the PAUSE1 bunny did not have no money
and then the dog came over
and they both were standing there
but the bunny keeper said five cents
and they both looked very upset
but then they saw PAUSE1 the bunny's mom
so he went over to her
and he said mom I need five cents for the balloon because I lost PAUSE1 the dog's balloon PAUSE1 and went high up into the air
so she came over

PAUSE1 and the giraffe goes into the water and swims towards it PAUSE2 and gets the ball and gives it back to the elephant

and then he frowns and points to the sign that said no running
PAUSE1 the giraffe has a little model airplane with him
he PAUSE1 has the airplane in his hand and PAUSE1 kind of moves his hands around and sticks his tongue out and says
then the elephant takes the airplane from him PAUSE2 and drops it into the pool
and the giraffe looks mad at the elephant
and then the lifeguard sees the airplane
and the PAUSE1 elephant she explains to him what happened
and he reaches out to reach it

PAUSE1 then another elephant comes and has a net with her
she puts the net in the water and tries to scoop up the airplane
and she gets it out for the giraffe
then he is happy again and holds the airplane up PAUSE1 towards PAUSE1 his cheek
well PAUSE1 it looks like a bunny is playing with PAUSE2 another type of animal in a sandbox PAUSE1 I think maybe a dog
and they are building a sandcastle
and the bunny pours PAUSE1 a bucket of sand onto the sandcastle

and the PAUSE1 bunny has finished his lunch
and the dog has only PAUSE2 started a juice box and PAUSE1 eating its sandwich
and PAUSE1 the bunny is feeling dizzy from eating too fast PAUSE2 and faints
so the dog gets PAUSE1 a doctor rabbit PAUSE2 and he is bringing the doctor to the bunny
and PAUSE1 the doctor is examining the bunny
and the little bunny walks with the doctor
well the dog has PAUSE1 a wagon with a balloon tied to it

and PAUSE1 the dog still looks mad
and the bunny sees those balloons with the PAUSE1 man and starts walking towards it
and he buys a balloon
PAUSE1 and he shows him that the balloons are five cents a balloon
so then the dog comes to see PAUSE1 what is going on with the bunny and PAUSE1 the man
and the PAUSE1 bunny goes to the doctor PAUSE2 and probably PAUSE1 asks for five cents PAUSE1 to buy a balloon because he has no money
so the PAUSE1 doctor buys two balloons PAUSE1 for PAUSE2 ten cents five cents per balloon
and they are both pretty happy

and then the elephant probably starts to tell PAUSE1 the elephant lifeguard that PAUSE1 she accidentally dropped it into the PAUSE1 water
and she probably asking him can you get it out for us
and the elephant starts to try to get it out
but I do not think he can reach
and they are like whoa I do not think he can reach
and then PAUSE1 the giraffe starts to cry
and then the elephant was like uhoh again
I am PAUSE1 going to get mad at for dropping in the plane
and then a girl elephant comes over
and she has one of those net things you know
and she is probably going to fish it out and like yay probably for PAUSE1 her
and then she gets it
she dips it into the water PAUSE1 and PAUSE1 scoops it up
and then PAUSE1 I think the giraffe is still probably crying
but PAUSE1 PAUSE1 the lifeguard is happy
and then the other elephant PAUSE1 the PAUSE1 little one PAUSE1 was actually like hope this one gets it
and then she scoops it up picks it up and then gives it to the giraffe
and both of them are happy
and now PAUSE1 the giraffe is really happy
and the elephant is really happy
and the giraffe is hugging the airplane
I think it looks like a rabbit PAUSE1 and a dog
the dog is making a sandcastle
and it looks like the rabbit wants to join in to make the PAUSE1 sandcastle
and the rabbit has a pail of sand with a shovel in it
and he starts to dig in it
and the guy is shaping it the dog
and then the rabbit starts to pour it on the sandcastle
and he is like PAUSE1 kind of PAUSE1 sad or scared of what is going to happen to it
and then PAUSE1 it wrecks it
it comes out with a big pile of sand but with just one little building on top but with the whole mound
and then the PAUSE1 rabbit is uhoh
and then PAUSE1 the dog is kind of PAUSE1 oh
and then the rabbit is sort of like a sorry look
and I think the dog is crying
and he is trying to PAUSE1 maybe to shape it
and there is two little more humps PAUSE1 with the sandcastle
that is all
PAUSE1 they are the same two characters from the one b@l I think
and they both have picnic baskets
and the rabbit is walking down on the forest PAUSE1 on the path
and he meets the dog with the PAUSE1 other PAUSE1 PAUSE1 PAUSE2 basket
and PAUSE1 the rabbit starts to take out all the food
there is carrots sandwich cake another sandwich PAUSE1 pickles cookies PAUSE1 chips PAUSE1 another sandwich
there is a lot of stuff
PAUSE1 and then he has the carrot and the sandwich in his hand
PAUSE1 PAUSE1 yum I am going to eat this
and then the dog just takes out one sandwich
he is like whoa PAUSE1 this guy eats a lot
and PAUSE1 the rabbit starts to gobble it all up
and there is crumbs left
there is an apple core PAUSE1 a juice box I think PAUSE1 some crumbs
and then he has a big tummy
and he is still munching his food
and the lunch box is tipped over
and then the dog is just sitting there PAUSE1 munching on his sandwich and has a juice box in his hand
and then the rabbit goes whoa that is a lot of food
and then he kind of falls over it looks like PAUSE1 cause he PAUSE1 probably has a tummyache
and then PAUSE1 the dog is like whoa what is wrong with him
and he still has the PAUSE1 sandwich and the juice box in his hand
and then PAUSE1 PAUSE1 there is a mother rabbit
it is probably the rabbit's mother
she is walking down
and then PAUSE1 the little dog goes and PAUSE1 tells her that probably the PAUSE1 rabbit is lying there PAUSE1 has a stomachache
and PAUSE1 he starts to pull on her to come over PAUSE1 and check on him to make sure he is okay
and there is a big twirl coming over the PAUSE1 rabbit's face
and then PAUSE1 the older rabbit is a doctor
and he has
and then she has glasses
and she has PAUSE1 one of those PAUSE1 things that go down there
and then PAUSE1 she is probably telling him to open wide or to not eat so much food
and then PAUSE1 the doctor rabbit says PAUSE1 I guess he feels better
and he gets up and starts to walk with the doctor
and then and the dog starts to smile
the rabbit is walking down
and the dog has a balloon in it PAUSE1 that is tied to a wagon
and I think she is pulling it
and PAUSE1 then the rabbit says probably can I look at it and PAUSE1 wants to hold it
and then probably the dog says yeah sure
and then PAUSE1 she starts to untie it
and the dog is PAUSE1 like a little surprised PAUSE1 think PAUSE1 yeah
and then PAUSE1 I guess the balloon floats away
it is floating away
and the rabbit is like no
and the dog is no either
and then PAUSE1 the dog gets really mad like hm
I am really mad at you
and the rabbit is like hm yeah
he is like PAUSE1 scared of him maybe
and then they see PAUSE1 another rabbit PAUSE1 with all these balloons
and then PAUSE1 the dog still has a mad face on it
and the rabbit is like woo maybe you can get one from there
and then PAUSE1 the rabbit runs over to probably ask if they could have one
and then they cost five PAUSE1 cents PAUSE1 for the balloons
but PAUSE1 she does not have none
and the dog comes running PAUSE1 over
and then the dog and the rabbit have really sad faces
and PAUSE1 the PAUSE1 older rabbit I guess has like PAUSE1 I am proud of myself
then they see the doctor rabbit
and the other little rabbit that is the baby runs over to her probably ask her for a balloon
and the rabbit asks her if they could get a balloon too PAUSE1 probably PAUSE1 for one PAUSE1 for each of them
then PAUSE1 the rabbit comes over and gives ten cents to get both of them a balloon
and she gives it to PAUSE1 him
and PAUSE1 rabbit is holding the two balloons out PAUSE1 for them to get
and then everyone is all happy
the dog is like PAUSE1 hugging it
and the rabbit is holding and hugging probably it
the rabbit is really happy PAUSE1 older rabbit

my friend is hurt
so she PAUSE1 pulled him over
and PAUSE1 the doctor started to look
the doctor said you should not have ate so much food
and you would not have got sick
the doctor helped the bunny back home
once upon a time there was a dog

behind her she saw a bunny
the bunny said what a nice balloon

he tied it to his arm
and they started off on their way
it unloosened and went off the bunny's hand
and it floated into the sky
the dog was very mad PAUSE1 at the bunny
down the road the bunny saw PAUSE1 a balloon man
and he said what a nice surprise

so he bought one
PAUSE1 PAUSE2 and he gave it to PAUSE1 the dog
PAUSE2 the dog saw the PAUSE1 rabbit PAUSE1 buying one
he saw the PAUSE1 doctor and ran to him

the lifeguard PAUSE1 is kind of shrugging his shoulders thinking what can I do
and then another PAUSE1 person comes with a net PAUSE1 and gets it out for them
and the giraffe is really really happy
and PAUSE1 the giraffe is hugging his toy
the bunny and PAUSE1 something else are playing
I think it is a dog that are playing PAUSE1 with sand

he dumps sand on a sandcastle
then the sandcastle is all wrecked
the bunny feels really bad

the bunny and the PAUSE1 dog I think are going for a picnic
PAUSE1 the bunny is eating too much
he has PAUSE1 maybe twenty things
he is eating lots
and PAUSE1 the bunny is really full
and the dog is just eating his sandwich and drinking juice box
and the bunny PAUSE1 is feeling dizzy

there is the dog and the bunny
the bunny is coming down PAUSE1 the road PAUSE1 jogging

and the dog is really mad at the bunny
then the bunny goes PAUSE1 to the balloon man
he asks for a balloon
he says five cents for a balloon
and the bunny has no money
so the little bunny looks at the PAUSE1 balloon man very innocently PAUSE2 and then goes to his dad or whatever PAUSE1
I just see him going to his dad or PAUSE1 the doctor
he asks for money
and PAUSE1 he asks for some money

Sara and mark went to the park one day
when they got there they saw a mysterious spaceship
they thought it was a ride
but when they saw what had came out of the spaceship , Sara thought it was cool
but mark didn't like it at all
mark said no please
don't make me go there
so she grabbed him by his arm and pulled him over
when she really saw that they were real she realized that there was some kind of weird monsters invading the park
when they looked at the spaceship they saw a weird sign
Michelle took a paper out of mark's pocket and a pencil she had saved from schools the other day
and she wrote down the sign
it was Sara's sign
the spaceship closed up
and the aliens had a picnic
spaceship took off and left
but Michelle and mark ran to the library to figure out what the sign meant
they went to the library
and they they found a book of signs and mysterious writings
they finally found the signs
what what she read was Ladge
she couldn't read it but she knew mark's father knows the language lad
so she took her library card out
she borrowed the book
she went to mark's father's house
so they went there
and mark asked do you know what this says
his father said yes I do
he said that it meant something about aliens coming to earth
and they were gonna invade the earth
Sara and and mark grabbed the book and ran right out the door
they went back to the park
and they saw the aliens eating their food and packing
and they left
after that they packed up and left in the woods
Sara and mark followed them
mark said it was a very bad idea to go follow them
but Michelle didn't care
she grabbed him by his wrist again and pulled him through the park that went through the woods and trees and forest
the little dog looked behind once
but they hid behind trees
the dog couldn't see them
the dog heard it
but none of the aliens did
the aliens didn't have ears or noses
the aliens just took off
and then went farther into the woods
mark kept on saying I'm not allowed to go any farther past the bushes
she said okay
then then I want you to wait here by the bushes for me real fast
so she went in and followed them
and the trail led to a mysterious house made out of sticks, leaves, rocks, any kind of wood, metal, and ice
the house was mysterious
Michelle knocked on the door twice
she felt a cold chill
mark was worried
he thought she she had got lost
so he went and followed her
he saw her footprints on the ground so he followed them too
then he saw Michelle
he screamed Michelle
don't go in
Michelle didn't care
she turned around
she thought she heard something else besides mark
she went back
she turned around and said mark did you hear that
he said no
it sounded like somebody was eating something
they peaked through the window made out of ice
they saw the aliens were eating a strange kind of animal
they thought it was the dog
but then they saw the dog under the table
they went back in the library once more
they returned the book
and they got out a new book with strange and mysterious animals
they found one in it that said anteaters
it said anteaters
then when they came back the aliens were done with the anteaters
and they put the anteaters by the window sill
mark ran back through the forest to the park and laid down on the ground
he almost passed out
Michelle looked inside
she thought it was cool
she broke the ice with a rock she found from the house
she took an anteater home to prove that there were aliens
and one of the alien's little dots on the testicles fell off onto the anteater
and she showed the the father
but their mother was the scientist
so they showed it to the mother
and the mother studied it
and the mother found out that they were really aliens
so the mother and father went out with mark and and Michelle
and they went back to the house
they looked in the window
they they tried to look for the house but the house was gone
when they went back to the park the spaceship was gone like nothing had ever happened
but there was only one sign
they saw one of the dog's feathers of the tail got chopped off
I think when they were chopping one of the anteaters inside, I think by accident chopped a feather of the dog
the family picked up the feather
and give it to the mom
the mom went and studied it
and found out that it was an large anteater
anteater anteater eats alien's testicles
so when they studied it the mother found out they were really aliens
and then the mother went back to the park
they saw a new spaceship they had put in the in the park
they went inside
it was a ride
that day mark and Michelle were confused
they didn't know if it was some people dressed up in costumes playing an act at the park, somebody doing script, or was it for real

then they notice there's something
so they stick their heads out the window
and they go wait you forgot your little baby

they're like well we got a call that my father's in the hospital
we needta go back as soon as we can
so then they wave goodbye
and Marsha and Tim go we'll miss you
and then when the aliens leave Marsha and Tim tell their parents see we told you
and then the parents said maybe there are aliens
but still that doesn't mean you should go off yelling about them
they might get abducted
and they seem like very nice people
they're like can we write to them
and their parents just started laughing and laughing

he was ripping his shoelaces so hard trying to put it on
and they snapped
he decided just not to tie his shoes at all
when he was running out his shoes were slipping
he decided to wear different shoes
he ran back upstairs, got a different pair of shoes, put those on, and tied them without so much pulling and tugging
he ran outside
the bus was leaving

Sarah heard the phone ring
she answered it
it was a squeaky voice
it was her friend
well that's what the person said at least
she said hi Sarah this is Michelle
my family's having a picnic
would you like to come
and she's like why is your voice so squeaky
oh my phone isn't working very well
and she's like bring your brother Shane along
my brother David will be there
so they told their parents
and they went outside
they looked
they were walking there
and suddenly over the bush they saw an alien family and a flying saucer
but it was landed
someone was waving goodbye from the saucer
Shane wanted to hide behind the bush and sneak away home
but Michelle said oh how bad can these aliens be
they have two arms and just a couple more legs than we do
a couple more Shane said
about lets just say fifty more
and she's like oh come on Shane
she grabbed Shane
and they went
the aliens had the squeaky voice
the same voice she heard that that said this was Michelle, Sarah's friend
so Sarah said where's my friend Michelle
they pointed to a little girl
that's not my friend Michelle unless you're in your halloween costume because halloween's not until next month
well, no no I'm your friend Michelle
I've been watching you
all those phone calls you got that I have been talking to you
those weren't from any of your friend Michelle
that wasn't from your friend Michelle that's here on earth with you
that was from me
and I'm like I have a friend alien
I don't think so
I haven't even met you before
Sarah screamed
the alien put their hand over it
don't worry
we won't hurt you
we come in peace
and then she said what are you doing here
well we hear your family has some problems
and she's like no, no problems in a mysterious way
well said Michelle the alien then how come you're so sad and always cry in the bathroom
I don't do that Michelle said
David started laughing
Sarah told David to be quiet
she's talking to this alien
so David was quiet
and he's like well that's not even true
Sarah's standing there and she's like yes it is
you're sad because your aunt might die
she's like well she might
but I wasn't crying in the bathroom
I'm not trying to embarrass you
it's natural to cry
and she's like you're an alien
how do you know anything
she's like aliens have feelings too
suddenly Sarah noticed a little llama llama but dog type animal
said what in the world is that thing that you're holding with a leash
oh this is my pet Grucchi she said
Grucchi, what type of animal is that
it's a dogape@n
a dogape@n
what's a dogape@n
it's a dogape@n
it's a pet
Sarah's very confused
now she was thinking this can't be true
so she grabbed their head
but nothing came off except a speck of skin
Sarah was very scared now
the saucer was gone
and they put all their luggage down
are you moving here she said nervously
of_course we are
we like it down in here on earth
we wanna meet some of you earthlings
but but we're different than you
we only have two legs
and we don't have dogapes@n
we have dogs
and she's like oh I won't hurt you
we both have two arms, five fingers and one head
I'm sure we'll be fine together
we could be best friends
suddenly Sarah said where's my friend Michelle
2. Michelle she's at her house watching tv
well that's what she was doing when I got into the saucer
well I'm leaving
and she's like don't leave yet
we wanna come with you
she's like never
so David and Sarah ran home
they told their parents
their parents said oh it's probably just some crazy person dressing up
but but I tried to grab their head off and only skin came off Sarah said nervously and sort of angry that her parents wouldn't believe her
come here and I'll show you
when they got back there the aliens were gone
they went to every house in the neighborhood
and finally at Michelle's house there were the aliens
well Michelle her friend's house
but Michelle the alien lived there too
and her family was there
but she didn't have her brother for David to play with
she said she remembered what she said
why did I hafta bring David
you don't have a brother
of_course I do Grucchi
my dogape@n is my brother
David shouted well I'm never gonna be friends with a dogape@n
I'm never gonna be friends with any alien or alien pet
and they're like but why are you at Michelle's house
oh because we knew this this was the only place you would go
their parents were now with them
their parents, Michelle, David were all shocked in terror
they couldn't get rid of these aliens
suddenly the the aliens took off their skin
and they were regular people
in fact they were Michelle's cousins
Sarah had met them before but just once
and she's like you're regular people
then how come when I tried to take off our skin
these aren't special things
we got them at the costume store in California where we live
here up in Ohio they don't have any good costumes
and what about that dogape@n thing
oh this is just mechanical
what about the saucer
I work at a space space thing
then how come the saucer wasn't there anymore
it has wheels
it it didn't seem very clear to Sarah
but I guess she hadta believe it
she didn't know if she wanted to believe it
but she tried
she went home wondering
she never really did ever believe in aliens until now at least
she wondered if there really was such thing as aliens
and they were really alien in a costume as a human
that night Sarah couldn't go to sleep
finally she went to sleep
but she never forgot that day with the aliens

and their mom told them that they were gonna eat out
then their mom asked where do you guys wanna eat
and they both yelled Mcdonalds
so their mom drove them to the nearest Mcdonalds
when they went in Lisa couldn't decide what she wanted to eat a Big_Mac or a happymeal
but her brother and her mom both knew what they were gonna get
her brother ordered a cheeseburger a vanilla shake and fries
and her mom ordered a hamburger
then Lisa finally decided she wanted a happymeal
so Lisa ordered a happymeal and a chocolate ice+cream cone
the total was twelve dollars and ninety five cents
and then when her mom went to get the money she realized that she had left her purse home on the kitchen counter
one morning Jiminey woke up
and he thought that oh it's a saturday
so I'm gonna sleep in
so he slept in
and then he thought oh no
then his alarm clock went off
he thought oh no
I forgot
it's a monday
so he hadta wake up and hurry to get his breakfast
and when he went into the kitchen all the cereal was gone
and he only had milk
and he spilt it all over the table
so then he hadta clean it up real fast because he was already late for school
then after he cleaned it up Jiminey was trying to hurry and pull his shoelaces tight
and then his shoelace snapped
so he hadta go and find another pair of shoelaces as quick as he could
but then when he went to look for them he couldn't find any shoelaces
so he hadta take his brother's shoes which didn't quite fit him
so his toe was almost sticking out of the end
then by the time he got all his stuff together he went to go to the school bus
and the school bus had left
so he was chasing the school bus to school
and he fell in a mud puddle
so he was all dirty when he went to school
and his teacher said Jiminey why are you late
and he goes well I thought it was a saturday
and then he went in school for class
once upon a time it was saturday at twelve o'clock
and Jane went out to the park to play because she told her mom
and her mom said sure but take your brother along
so Jane ran as fast as she could to get away from her brother because they were playing tag
when she finally got to the park she stopped to catch her breath
then out of the corner of her eye she saw a person with eight legs no hair and with purple skin and polkadots
so she ran as fast as she could to get her brother
Jane said Daniel Daniel come see what I found
he goes hang_on a second Jane
I wanna walk
so then Jane goes but Daniel I found aliens
I think
and then Daniel goes aliens huh
aliens live in outerspace
and there's probably none
so then she pulled Daniel as hard as she could
and then she peeked out of the corner of her eye again
and she saw them
it was actually the whole family and their dog with fire all the way into its feet
Daniel goes woah@c come_on lets go tell mom
and she goes no wait
this could be a secret
but first we hafta make sure they stay here and trap them somehow
and then we can come get our friends and show them as proof
so then Daniel set up a trap for the aliens as Jane ran back to get her mom dad and some of her best friends
so they followed her
and when the aliens went to the picnic table it collapsed
and they were trapped in a cage with metal bars so they couldn't get out
then when her friends saw they go oh_my_gosh
it's aliens

when they hide behind the bushes they couldn't believe their eyes
they saw an alien family
a little girl a mom a brother an alien dog and a friend named Maria
when Megan saw this she was in love because she loved aliens
she said come on Christopher don't be afraid

what if they can speak to us
I don't think they can speak to us
do you see the alien writing on the ship
yeah but I can read alien writing

and she said hello
we will not hurt you
oh but we will

suddenly when they saw the aliens they said we are going to suck your brains out
and the little one ran as fast as she could and tried to catch them
she caught Megan
Megan squealed and kicked the alien in the head
she finally ran out in the woods and got home
when she got home she said mom dad come here quick quick quick
and then that is what the same thing Christopher did
when they went back to the aliens they couldn't find the aliens
so they went home again

David and lily were walking in the park

so lily look at that saucer
they thought it could be a big meteorite instead
it started slowing down when it came to the earth
then it came down and landed on the earth
and then a door came flying down
then David and lily knew that it was an alien saucer
so then they went and hid behind some brushy bushes and peered over the top
and and they saw the door open
and then they saw these little figures coming out
they saw one leg two leg three legs four legs five legs lots of legs coming out of the things
they knew that it would be alien
so the alien
so they hid because they have all these little dots over them
and they look like chicken+pox
and they had this weird dog an alien dog
and then they land
and then lily started to run over to try to meet them
but but David said no wait they could hurt us
they're not from our land
they're from mars I think or from another galaxy
s
but lily didn't pay any attention
she just kept on trying to meet them
and then lily finally listened
she didn't go to meet them because they looked weird
but they had nice smiles
so then they went home
and so the next day they came back
and the aliens also were still there
and so they wondered why it would stay here
and they wondered where the aliens were
and they looked all around
and then they finally saw that they were eating the picnic
and then they they watched them go and play on the playground
and then they fell asleep
so Elaina and David looked in the alien saucer
looked like nothing was there
except on the other side there was probably something
they went in and looked on the other side
they saw that there was nothing
and they saw this big red button
and then they saw all these weird curves on the side
so they knew that at last they hadta push the red button for the stuff like the chair to be and the guns and all the other stuff
and so that they now roll why that's where all the stuff went
so now they know that they're hiding it because they don't want anybody to take off in their ship while they're still here
so that's why they hid it
so then right when they got out they hid in the bushes again
then they were starting to wake up
and then they went back on their alien saucer and went back and got some drinks
and and then they came back out
and there they saw the weird dog again
and there was many many many legs and those green spots on their faces
and then Elaina jumped up from behind the brush and started to run towards the aliens again
but David said no no no no wait wait
we don't know any of them
and Elaina didn't pay any attention
so she just kept on trying to meet them
and then David pulled her back
and she fell on her bottom
so did David
and then they went over and had a picnic
and then they went back into the playground
and they took a nap
and they keeps on going over and over again
