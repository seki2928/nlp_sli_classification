 he
 try
 pour
 the
 milk
 and
 the
 milk
 spill
 all
 over
 the

 so
 he
 was
 already
 sposta
 be

 one
 leg
 two
 leg
 three
 leg
 four
 leg
 five
 leg
 lot
 of
 leg
 come
 out
 of
 the
 thing
 they
 knew
 that
 it
 would
 be

 so
 the
 alien
 so
 they
 hid
 because
 they
 have
 all
 these
 little
 dot
 over
 them
 and
 they
 look
 like
 chick en
 pox
 and
 they
 had
 this
 weird
 dog
 an

 dog
 and
 then
 they

 but
 but
 david
 say
 no
 wait
 they
 could
 hurt
 us
 they
 not
 from
 our
 land
 they
 from

 i
 think
 or
 from
 another
 galaxy
 ss
 but
 lily
 did
 pay
 any
 attend ion
 she
 just
 kept
 on
 try
 to
 meet
 them
 and
 then
 lily
 final ly
 listen
 she
 did
 go
 to
 meet
 them
 because
 they
 look
 weird
 but
 they
 had
 nice
 smile
 so
 then
 they
 went
 home
 and
 so
 the
 next
 day
 they
 came
 back
 and
 the
 alien
 also
 were
 still
 there
 and
 so
 they
 wonder
 why
 it
 would
 stay
 here
 and
 they
 wonder
 where
 the
 alien
 were
 and
 they
 look
 all
 around
 and
 then
 they
 final ly
 saw
 that
 they
 were
 eat
 the
 picnic
 and
 then
 they
 they
 watch
 them
 go

 and
 they
 saw
 this

 push
 the
 red
 button
 for
 the
 stuff
 like
 the
 chair

 and
 so
 that
 they
 now
 roll
 why
 that
 where
 all
 the
 stuff
 went
 so
 now
 they
 know
 that
 they
 hide
 it
 because
 they
 don
 want
 any body
 to
 take
 off
 in
 their
 ship
 while
 they
 still
 here
 so
 that
 why
 they
